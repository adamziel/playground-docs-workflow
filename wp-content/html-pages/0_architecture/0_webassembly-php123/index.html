<p>Building PHP to WebAssembly is very similar to building vanilla PHP. The wasm build required <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/blob/0d451c33936a8db5b7a158fa8aad288c19370a7d/packages/php-wasm/compile/build-assets/php7.1.patch#L8-L9">adjusting a function signature here</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/blob/0d451c33936a8db5b7a158fa8aad288c19370a7d/packages/php-wasm/compile/Dockerfile#L495">forcing a config variable there</a>, and applying <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/tree/0d451c33936a8db5b7a158fa8aad288c19370a7d/packages/php-wasm/compile/build-assets">a few small patches</a>, but there's relatively few adjustments involved.</p>

<p>However, vanilla PHP builds aren't very useful in the browser. As a server software, PHP doesn't have a JavaScript API to pass the request body, upload files, or populate the <code>php://stdin</code> stream. WordPress Playground had to build one from scratch. The WebAssembly binary comes with a <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/blob/0d451c33936a8db5b7a158fa8aad288c19370a7d/packages/php-wasm/compile/build-assets/php_wasm.c">dedicated PHP API module</a> written in C and a <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/blob/da38192af57a95699d8731c855b82ac0222df61b/packages/php-wasm/common/src/lib/php.ts">JavaScript PHP class</a> that exposes methods like writeFile() or run().</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because every PHP version is just a static .wasm file, the PHP version switcher is actually pretty boring. It simply tells the browser to download, for example, <code>php_7_3.wasm</code> instead of, say, <code>php_8_2.wasm</code>.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Networking support varies between platforms</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to networking, WebAssembly programs are limited to calling JavaScript APIs. It is a safety feature, but also presents a challenge. How do you support low-level, synchronous networking code used by PHP with the high-level asynchronous APIs available in JavaScript?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In Node.js, the answer involves a WebSocket to TCP socket proxy, <a href="https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/asyncify.html">Asyncify</a>, and patching deep PHP internals like php_select. It's complex, but there's a reward. The Node.js-targeted PHP build can request web APIs, install composer packages, and even connect to a MySQL server.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the browser, networking is supported to a limited extent. Network calls initiated using <code>wp_safe_remote_get</code>, like the ones in the plugin directory or the font library, are translated into <code>fetch()</code> calls and succeed if the remote server sends the correct CORS headers. However, a full support for arbitrary HTTPS connection involves opening a raw TCP socket which is not possible in the browser. There is an <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues/85">open GitHub issue</a> that explores possible ways of addressing this problem.</p>
