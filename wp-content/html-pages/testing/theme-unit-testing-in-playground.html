<h2>Import Theme Unit Test Data</h2>

WordPress theme unit test data is a collection of test data for WordPress themes. It is used to test the compatibility of themes with WordPress. The data includes posts, pages, comments, custom post types, tags, categories, and more.

It showcases the style of the elements, and creates pages with examples of almost every type of content you can create in WordPress. The purpose is to check to see how the theme handles each of these different types of content, and if style adjustments are needed.

<h2>Needs CORs headers</h2>

Something isn't working...
https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues/718
(theme data can't be imported due to CORS restrictions)

<h3>Possible workaround</h3>

<ul>
<li>It is a CORS issue (simply include in URL fragment?)</li>
<li>Or convert to another API example (ie. <code>fetch</code>)</li>
</ul>
