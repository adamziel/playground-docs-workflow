## WordPress Playground for Documenters

This is an attempt to create a buildless Documentation Contributor Workflow that uses WordPress Playground to:

* Fetch the latest version of the documentation from the repository.
* Edit documentation in a browser-based editor.
* Preview the changes in real-time.
* (TBD) Submit the changes as a pull request.
* Provide a live preview of the documentation PR.

It's a work in progress and the GitHub integration is not fully implemented yet.

[<kbd> <br>Try the latest version<br> </kbd>](https://playground.wordpress.net/?blueprint-url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adamziel/playground-docs-workflow/trunk/wp-docs-plugin/blueprint.json). 

It should load the doc pages from the `html-pages` directory.
